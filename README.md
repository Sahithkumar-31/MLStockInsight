Introduction:

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends, specifically the rise and fall of stock prices, leveraging machine learning techniques. The dataset used spans a 5-year period, containing crucial features such as opening and closing prices, high and low values, volume, date, and the associated company information.

Data Preprocessing:

The initial steps involved importing the dataset and conducting essential preprocessing. Unnecessary features, such as volume, were removed to streamline the dataset. Unwanted companies were also trimmed to concentrate on a subset of stocks for more focused analysis. A critical step in the process was converting the 'date' column, initially in object format, into a datetime object for time-series analysis.

Feature Selection:

The choice of features for predicting stock market trends is crucial. Opening and closing prices, along with high and low values, serve as fundamental indicators. The removal of irrelevant features ensures a more efficient and targeted model.

Model Selection:

Two machine learning models were employed for predicting stock market trends: Linear Regression and Decision Tree. Linear Regression offers simplicity and interpretability, while Decision Trees, with a depth of 3, bring a non-linear dimension to capture more complex patterns in the data.

Training and Testing:

The model training process involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The model learned patterns and relationships from the historical stock data during the training phase. The testing set, unseen during training, was used to evaluate the model's predictive performance.

Evaluation Metrics:

The performance of the models was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics. Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the models capture and generalize the underlying patterns in the stock market data.

Results:

The trained regression models demonstrated the ability to predict stock market trends based on historical data. The models' predictive power was assessed using the testing set, and the evaluation metrics provide a quantitative measure of their performance.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project presents an effective approach to predicting stock market rise and fall using regression models. By leveraging machine learning techniques and carefully selecting features, the models showcase the potential for aiding investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions based on historical stock data.
